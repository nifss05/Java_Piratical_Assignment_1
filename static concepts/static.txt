1. What is a Static Variable in Java?
A static variable is shared among all instances of a class and belongs to the class itself, not to any specific object.

2. What is Static Loading and How Does the Java Program Actually Do It?
Static loading refers to loading classes into memory before use. Java does this at runtime when the class is first accessed, initializing static variables and blocks.

3. Can We Mark a Local Variable as Static?
No, local variables cannot be marked as static.

4. Why is the main Method Static in Java?
The main method is static so the JVM can call it without creating an instance of the class.

5. Why is a Static Method Able to Call Static Variables and Static Methods?
A static method can access only static variables and methods because they belong to the class itself, not to any particular instance.

6. What is the Use of Static Blocks in Java?
Static blocks are used for initializing static variables and performing setup actions when the class is loaded.

7. Difference Between Static and Instance Variables
Static Variables: Shared among all instances; exist as long as the class is loaded.
Instance Variables: Unique to each object; exist as long as the object exists.

8. Difference Between Static and Non-Static Methods
Static Methods: Belong to the class; can only access static variables/methods.
Non-Static Methods: Belong to instances; can access both static and instance variables/methods.
