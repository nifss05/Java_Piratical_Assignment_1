1. What is a Constructor in Java?
 A constructor initializes objects. It has the same name as the class and no return type.
 Example: public MyClass() {}

2. What is Constructor Chaining?
 Constructor Chaining: Calling one constructor from another in the same class or from a parent class.
 Example: this(), super()

3. Can You Call a Java Class Constructor from Another Class Constructor?
 Yes, you can call one class's constructor from another classâ€™s constructor using super().
 Example: public SubClass() { super(); }

4. What is the Purpose of this() in a Constructor?
 this(): Calls another constructor in the same class.

Example: public MyClass() { this(5); }

5. What is a No-Argument Constructor?
  A No-Argument Constructor has no parameters and initializes default values.
  Example: public MyClass() {}

6. How is a No-Argument Constructor Different from a Default Constructor?
 No-Argument Constructor: Explicitly defined with no parameters.
 Default Constructor: Implicitly provided by Java if no constructors are defined.

7. When to Use Constructor Overloading?
 Use Constructor Overloading to create multiple ways to initialize an object with different parameters.
 Example: public MyClass(int a) {}, public MyClass(int a, int b) {}

8. What is a Default Constructor? Explain with an Example.
  A Default Constructor is provided by Java if no other constructors are defined. It initializes instance variables to default values.
